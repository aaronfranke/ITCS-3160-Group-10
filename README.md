With the threat of the Corona virus, food delivery services are more important
than ever. Local restaurants are eager to find easy ways to have food
delivered to customers without having to hire delivery employees. Even when
things return to normal, many experts feel that food delivery will be something
that we all will have become accustomed to as a part of our regular activites
(even more than before). Students love food delivery services on campus.
Campuses do not like the steady stream of visitors that may or may not have
a formal connection with the university. Companies such as UberEats and
GrubHub are happy to deliver on campus, but many schools are wondering if
they should take control of the delivery and ensure that students and
authorized university employees are the only ones delivering food on campus
for safety and health reasons.
