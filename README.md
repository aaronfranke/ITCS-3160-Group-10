## Campus Eats Rating System<br>ITCS 3160 Group 10

This project adds a rating system to the Campus Eats database. The rating system allows customers of Campus Eats to rate both drivers and restaurants.

## Introduction

With the threat of the Corona virus, food delivery services are more important than ever. Local restaurants are eager to find easy ways to have food delivered to customers without having to hire delivery employees. Even when things return to normal, many experts feel that food delivery will be something that we all will have become accustomed to as a part of our regular activities (even more than before). Students love food delivery services on campus. Campuses do not like the steady stream of visitors that may or may not have a formal connection with the university. Companies such as UberEats and GrubHub are happy to deliver on campus, but many schools are wondering if they should take control of the delivery and ensure that students and authorized university employees are the only ones delivering food on campus for safety and health reasons.

This project adds a rating system for the drivers and restaurants. The rating system will allow food delivery customers to rate both the restaurant and the food delivery person. Every time a customer places an order for delivery, they will have an opportunity to rate the restaurant and the driver for that order after the food has been delivered. New orders will provide the customer with new opportunities to place ratings. We will be using a 5 level rating system with a comment field for rating drivers and restaurants. We believe the simplicity of this rating system will encourage its use and will provide valuable feedback to all stakeholders: the restaurant owner, the delivery driver, and current and future restaurant customers.
